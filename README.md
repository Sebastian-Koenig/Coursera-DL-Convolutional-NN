# Coursera-DL-Convolutional-NN
This repository contains my Coursera Deeplearing Convolutional Neural Network Workbooks in html format and serves primarily as part of my portfolio. Code is written in Python, employing Numpy, TensorFlow and Keras. 
Code is documented in detail in the html documents:
* Convolution_model_Application_v1a.html contains a basic CNN for signlanguage number recognition.
* Face_Recognition_v3a.html contains a rudimentary facial recognition algorithm.
* Autonomous_driving_application_Car_detection_v3a.html contains an object detection system.
* Art_Generation_with_Neural_Style_Transfer_v3a.html contains a basic Neural Style Transfer experiement, reproducing a picture in the stile of a painting.
